fetch data form website to controller using two way

1. Using HttpServletRequest
2. Using annotation base @RequestParam(here enter name="email" , required="type", value="")


HttpServletRequest ==> its a old way to accept data from website to controller

2nd way is the standard way

for better concept see the Register.java, regform.jsp and success.jsp...
